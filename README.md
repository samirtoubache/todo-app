# todo-app

Author: Samir Toubache

Description:
This web app lets the user create a todo list by adding tasks that can be checked off as complete or deleted.
The user can also search for specific todo items by typing into the search todo form and hide completed todos by checking the hide completed todos checkbox.
The todos are saved in local storage, therefore the user can access their todo list on the same device after they closed the site.

Technology:
This web app was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project helped me become more comfortable using event handlers and DOM manipulation, as well as writing ES6 Javascript.
